<p>A car is a wheeled, self-powered motor vehicle used for<br> transportation and a product of the automotive industry.</p> 
<p>Most definitions of the term specify that cars are designed<br> to run primarily on roads, to have seating for one to eight people,</P>
 <p>to typically have four wheels with tyres, and to be constructed<br> principally for the transport of people rather than goods.<br>
 The year 1886 is regarded as the birth year of the modern car.<br>
 In that year, German inventor Karl Benz built the Benz Patent-Motorwagen.<br>
 Cars did not become widely available until the early 20th century.</p>
 <p>One of the first cars that was accessible to the masses was the 1908 Model T,<br>
 an American car manufactured by the Ford Motor Company.<br> Cars were rapidly adopted in the United States of America,<br>
 where they replaced animal-drawn carriages and carts,<br>
 but took much longer to be accepted in Western<br> Europe and other parts of the world</p>
